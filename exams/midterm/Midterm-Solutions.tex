\begin{enumerate}[{\bf 1.}]
\item Give precise definitions of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf semigroup}

    \medskip

    {\it Answer:}\\
    A \emph{semigroup} is an algebraic structure consisting of a
    set together with an associative binary operation.

    {\it Equivalently:} \\
    A \emph{semigroup} is an algebraic structure 
    $\mathbf{A} = \<A, \cdot\>$, where $A$ is a set and 
    $\cdot: A^2 \rightarrow A$ is a binary operation on $A$ satisfying the
    associative law: $\forall a, b, c \in A$, 
    $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

    \medskip

  \item {\bf monoid}

    \medskip

    {\it Answer:}\\
    A \emph{monoid} is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an
    associative binary operation and an identity element (nullary operation). 

    {\it Equivalently:}\\
    A \emph{monoid} is an algebraic structure 
    $\mathbf{A} = \<A, \cdot, e\>$, where $\<A, \cdot\>$ is a semigroup and 
    $e$ is an element of $A$ satisfying $\forall a \in A$, $a\cdot e = a = e\cdot a$.

    \medskip

  \item {\bf group}

    \medskip
    
    {\it Answer:}\\
    A \emph{group} is an algebraic structure 
    $\bA = \langle A, \cdot, ^{-1}, e\rangle$
    consisting of a set $A$ together with a 
    binary operation $\cdot$, a unary operation 
    $^{-1}$, and a nullary operation $e$, all satisfying
    the following \emph{group laws}: for all $a, b, c \in A$,
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item (associativity) $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ 
    \item (identity) $a\cdot e = a = e\cdot a$
    \item (inverse) $a\cdot a^{-1} = e = a^{-1}\cdot a$
    \end{enumerate}

    {\it Equivalently:}\\
    A \emph{group} is a monoid along with a unary operation $^{-1}$
    satisfying $a\cdot a^{-1} =  a^{-1}\cdot a = e$ for all $a\in A$. 

    \medskip

  \item {\bf abelian group}

    \medskip
        {\it Answer:}\\
        An \emph{Abelian group} is a group with a commutative binary
        operation, which we usually denote by $+$ instead of $\cdot$.  
        In this case, we write $0$ instead of $e$ to denote the 
        \emph{additive identity}, and $-$ instead of $^{-1}$ to denote 
        the \emph{additive inverse}.  Thus, an Abelian group is an algebraic
        structure $\bA = \langle A, +, -, 0\rangle$ satisfying the laws of groups
        and the following \emph{commutative law}: $\forall a, b \in A$, $a+b = b+a$.

        \medskip

      \item {\bf cyclic group}

        \medskip
            {\it Answer:}\\
            If $G$ is a group and $g\in G$ and $G=\langle g\rangle$, then we say that
            $G$ is a {\bf cyclic group} and that $g$ is a {\bf generator} of $G$.

            (Here the notation $\langle g\rangle$ means $\{g^k: k\in \Z\}$.)
            
  \end{enumerate}

\item Let $G$ denote the symmetries of an equilateral triangle.

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item List the elements of this group using cycle notation.

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:}
    \begin{align*}
      \mathrm{id} &= (\phantom{X} )\\
      \mu_1 &= (1,2)\\
      \mu_2 &= (2,3)\\
      \mu_3 &= (1,3)\\
      \rho_1 &= (1,2,3)\\
      \rho_2 &= (1,3,2)
    \end{align*}
    \medskip

  \item What is the order of this group?

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} $|G| = 6$.

    \vskip1cm

  \item Is this group cyclic? Is it abelian?\\
    (Give a brief justification for your answers. You may cite 4(b).)

    \medskip
        
    {\bf Answer:} The group $G$ above is {\bf not abelian}.
    Indeed, there is at least one pair of
    noncommuting elements. For example, $\mu_1 \cdot \mu_2 = (1,2)(2,3) = (1,2,3)$, while
    $\mu_2 \cdot \mu_1 = (2,3)(1,2) = (1,3,2)$. Therefore,
    $\mu_1 \cdot \mu_2 \neq \mu_2 \cdot \mu_1$.

    The group $G$ above is {\bf not cyclic}.
    Indeed, recall that every cyclic group is abelian (See Problem 4(b).)
    Therefore, since $G$ is nonabelian, it is not cyclic.
  \end{enumerate}

  \newpage

\item Suppose $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$. Prove or disprove the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $H\cap K$ is a subgroup of $G$.

    \medskip
    {\bf Claim:} $H\cap K$ is a subgroup of $G$.

    \medskip    

    {\bf Proof:}
    Let $I = H\cap K$. We check that $I$ is a subgroup of $G$.
    Proposition 3.9 states that this is equivalent to showing that $I$ is closed
    under the three operations (nullary, unary, binary) of $G$.  In other words,
    we must show that $I$ contains the identity (the nullary op), 
    $I$ is closed under inverse (the unary op), and
    $I$ is closed under multiplication (the binary op). 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item  (nullary closure) Clearly $e\in I$ since both $H$ and $K$, being themselves
      subgroups, contain $e$.
    \item (unary closure) If $x\in I= H\cap K$, then
      $x \in H$ and $H$ is a subgroup, so $x^{-1}\in H$.
      Similarly, $x \in K$ and $K$ a subgroup implies $x^{-1}\in K$.
      Therefore, $x^{-1} \in H \cap K$.
    \item (binary closure) Suppose $x$ and $y$ belong to $H\cap K$.
      Then, since $x, y \in H$ and $H$ is a subgroup, we have $xy \in H$.
      Similarly, $x, y \in K$ and $K$ a subgroup implies $xy \in K$.  Therefore, 
      $xy \in H\cap K$.
    \end{itemize}

    \bigskip

  \item $H\cup K$ is a subgroup of $G$.

    \medskip
    This is false, and counterexamples abound.
    Here are two:

\medskip

    {\bf Example 1:}
    In the symmetry group of the triangle from Problem 2 above, let 
    $H = \<\mu_1\> = \{\mathrm{id}, \mu_1\}$ and 
    $K = \<\mu_2\> = \{\mathrm{id}, \mu_2\}$.  
    Then the set $H\cup K = \{\mathrm{id}, \mu_1, \mu_2\}$ is not a subgroup
    since it is not closed under the binary operation: 
    $\mu_1 \cdot \mu_2 = \rho_1\notin H\cup K$. 

\medskip

    {\bf Example 2:}
    In the group $\Z_3 \times \Z_3$ that appears in Exercise~33 of Chapter 3, we
    found that $\<(0,1)\> \cup \<(1,0)\> = \{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0)\},$
    which clearly is not closed under the binary operation of 
    addition modulo 3.  For instance, $(0,1) + (1,0) = (1,1)$ which does not belong
    to the union.
 
\vskip1cm

(See also: Homework 4, Exercises 3.44, 3.45.)
  \end{enumerate}
  \newpage

\item %Let $\mathbf{G} = \<G, \cdot, ^{-1}, e\>$ 
  Let $G$ be a group.  Prove the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $G$ is abelian if and only if $(gh)^2 = g^2h^2$ holds for all $g, h \in G$.

    \medskip

    {\it Proof:}\\
    ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $G$ is abelian.  Then for all $g, h \in G$ we have 
    \[
    (gh)^2 = (gh)(gh) = ghgh = gghh = g^2h^2.
    \]
    ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $(gh)^2 = g^2h^2$ holds for all $g, h \in G$. 
    Fix an arbitrary pair of elements $g, h \in G$.  We must show that
    $gh = hg$. By assumption, $(gh)^2 = g^2h^2$, that is
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:1}
    (gh)(gh) =  (gg)(hh).
    \end{equation}
    Multiplying both sides of~(\ref{eq:1}) on the left by $g^{-1}$ and on the
    right by $h^{-1}$, we have
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:2}
      g^{-1}(gh)(gh)h^{-1} = g^{-1}(gg)(hh)h^{-1}.
    \end{equation}
    By associativity, the left hand side of~(\ref{eq:2}) is
    $g^{-1}g \, hg \,hh^{-1} = e\, hg\, e = hg$, while the right hand side 
    is
    $g^{-1}g \, gh \,hh^{-1} = e\, gh\, e = gh$.
    Therefore, $hg = gh$. 

    \vskip1cm

  \item If $G$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.

    \medskip

    {\it Proof:}\\
    Suppose $G$ is cyclic.  Then $G = \<a\>$ for some $a \in G$.
    Fix an arbitrary pair of elements $g, h \in G$.  We must show that
    $gh = hg$.  Since $G = \<a\>$, we have $g = a^j$ for some $j\in \N$ and 
    $h = a^k$ for some $k\in \N$.  Therefore, 
    \[
    gh = a^j a^k = a^{j+k} = a^{k+j} = hg.
    \]

    \vskip1cm

  \item Give a specific example of a group $G$ and elements $g, h \in G$ for which $(gh)^2 \neq g^2h^2$. 
    (Justify your answer.)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} Again, the group of symmetries on a triangle that showed up in
    Problem 2 is an example.  Let $g = \mu_1$ and $h = \mu_2$.  Then
    $\mu_1^2 = \mathrm{id} = \mu_2^2$ and $\mu_1 \,\mu_2 = \rho_1$, so,
    \[
    (\mu_1\, \mu_2)^2 = \rho_1^2 = \rho_2 \neq \mathrm{id} = \mu_1^2 \, \mu_2^2.
    \]

    \vskip1cm
  
  \item Give a specific example of a group that is abelian but not cyclic.\\
    (No justification necessary.)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} Many direct products of cyclic groups are abelian but not
    cyclic.  For example, $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$ and $\Z_3 \times \Z_3$ are both
    abelian but not cyclic. 

    (On the other hand, the group $\Z_3 \times \Z_4$ is
    not only abelian, but also cyclic! Check that the element $(1,1)$ generates
    $\Z_3 \times \Z_4$. We will soon see that $\Z_3 \times \Z_4$ is
    just a ``copy'' of the cyclic group $\Z_{12}$, whereas $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$ is truly
    distinct from $\Z_4$.)
  \end{enumerate}

  \newpage
\item This problem has several parts.
  First, state the following (without proof):
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{The Well Ordering Principle.} (about subsets of natural numbers)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers is well ordered.

\vskip1cm

  \item \emph{The Division Algorithm.} (about integers $a$ and $b$ where $b>0$)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} If $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b>0$, then there exist integers
    $q, r$ such that $a = qb+r$ and $0\leq r < b$. 


    \vskip1cm

    Prove that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic by following the steps below.
    First, let $G = \<a\>$ be a cyclic group and fix an arbitrary subgroup $H\leq G$.

    \medskip

  \item Suppose $H$ contains only the identity, $e$. Say why $H$
    must be cyclic in this case. (one line/sentence)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} $H = \{e\} = \<e\>$ is one-generated, that is, cyclic.

    \vskip1cm

  \item Suppose instead that $H$ contains more than just the identity element. 
    Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer such that $a^m\in H$.  
    Why does such a number $m$ exists? (Hint: consider the set 
    $\{m \in \N: a^m \in H\}$; cite a well known principle; say
    why it applies here.)

    \medskip

    {\bf Answer:} 
    The set $\{m \in \N: a^m \in H\}$ is a subset of the natural numbers.
    We assumed $H$ contains more than just the identity, so there is some 
    $x \in H$ with $x \neq e$.  Since $x \in H \leq G = \<a\>$, there is some
    $m$ such that $x = a^m$. Therefore, the set $\{m \in \N: a^m \in H\}$ is
    nonempty, so it satisfies the hypotheses of the Well Ordering Principle,
    which states that it must be well ordered (i.e., have a least element). 

    \vskip1cm

  \item Finally, prove the {\bf Claim} stated on the {\bf next page}. $\rightarrow$ \\
    (which says that $a^m$ generates $H$, where $m$ is the number from part (b)).
    %% ; that is, prove that if $x$ is an arbitrary element of $H$, then
    %%     $x$ is a power of $a^m$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \newpage
      {\bf Claim:} If $H\leq G = \<a\>$ and $m$ is the smallest positive integer such
      that $a^m \in H$, then $H = \<a^m\>$.

      \medskip

      \noindent {\it Proof:} Let $x \in H$.  The claim is that $a^m$ generates
      $H$, so we need to prove that $x = a^{mq}$ for some $q \in \N$.  
      Since $x \in H \leq G = \<a\>$, we have $x = a^j$ for some $j$, and it
      suffices to show that $m$ divides $j$
      (since this will give $qm = j$ for some $q$, whence
      $x= a^j = a^{qm}$).

      By the division algorithm, there exist integers $q, r$ such that 
      $j = qm + r$ where $0\leq r < m$.  Therefore, 
      \[
      x = a^j = a^{qm+r} = a^{qm}a^r, \quad \text{ so } \quad a^{-qm}x = a^r.
      \]
      Now note that $a^{-qm} \in H$ and $x \in H$ together imply that $a^r \in H$. 
      But $0\leq r < m$ and $m$ is the smallest positive integer with $a^m \in H$. 
      Therefore, $r = 0$, so $j = qm$, and this proves that $m\divides j$.

      \newpage
    \item
      Answer either (a) or (b). Only one answer will be graded.  (If
      you answer both, then clearly mark which should be graded.)
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item 
        Show that, for any cyclic group $G = \<a\>$, 
        the subgroup $\<a^j, a^k\>$ generated by $a^j$ and $a^k$ is equal to
        $\<a^d\>$, where $d = \gcd(j,k)$.
        (Hint: Recall that there exist integers $r$ and $s$ such that $d = rj + sk$; you
        may use this fact without proving it.)
      \item
        Show that for any group $G$, and any fixed element $g \in G$,
        the map $\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G$ defined by
        $\lambda_g(a) = g a$ is a permutation of $G$.
        Then show that the order of the alternating group on $n$ letters is $|A_n| = n!/2$.
        %% (Hint: first explain why the order of $S_n$ is $n!$, then prove that exactly half
        %% of the elements of $S_n$ must be in $A_n$.)
      \end{enumerate}

    \medskip

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Claim:} $\<a^d\> = \<a^j, a^k\>$

    \medskip

    {\it Proof:}
    We first show $\<a^d\> \subseteq \<a^j, a^k\>$.
    Since $a^d = a^{rj+sk} = a^{rj}a^{sk} = (a^j)^r(a^k)^s$, we see that 
    $a^d \in \<a^j, a^k\>$, therefore, 
    $\<a^d\> \subseteq \<a^j, a^k\>$.
    
    Next we show $\<a^j, a^k\> \subseteq \<a^d\>$.  
    Since $d = \gcd(j,k)$ we
    have $d \divides j$ so $j = md$ for some integer $m$.  Therefore, 
    $a^j = a^{dm} \in \<a^d\>$.
    Similarly, $d \divides k$ so $k = nd$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, 
    $a^k = a^{dn} \in \<a^d\>$. Since $a^j$ and $a^k$ both belong to $\<a^d\>$,
    it follows that $\<a^j, a^k\> \subseteq \<a^d\>$.  

    \vskip1cm

  \item
{\bf Claim:}  For any group $G$, and any fixed element $g \in G$,
        the map $\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G$ defined by
        $\lambda_g(a) = g a$ is a permutation of $G$.

        \medskip

        {\it Proof:} We must show that $\lambda_g$ is one-to-one and onto.  Let
        $x, y \in G$ and suppose $\lambda_g(x) = \lambda_g(y)$.  Then $gx = gy$,
        so multiplying on the left of both sides by $g^{-1}$ we have
        $g^{-1}gx = g^{-1}gy$, that is,  $x = y$.  This proves that $\lambda_g$
        is one-to-one.  Let $z \in G$. To show $\lambda_g$ is onto, we must show
        that there is some $x \in G$ with $\lambda_g(x) = z$. Indeed, take 
        $x = g^{-1}z$.  Then $\lambda_g(x) = \lambda_g(g^{-1}z) = gg^{-1}z = z$.

        \vskip1cm

        {\bf Claim:} The order of the alternating group on $n$ letters is $|A_n| = n!/2$.

        \medskip

        {\it Proof:} We know there are $|S_n| = n!$ permutations in the full
        symmetric group on $n$ letters.  We want to show that half of these are
        even permutations.  
        %% (We will take for granted that the identity element
        %% belongs to $A_n$, that is, $\mathrm{id}$ is an even permutation.)  
        Let $B_n$ denote the set of odd permutations.  Fix
        some transposition  $\tau \in S_n$. Any transposition will do, for
        example, we could choose $\tau = (1,2)$. Then define 
        $\lambda_\tau: A_n \rightarrow B_n$ by 
        $\lambda_\tau(\sigma) = \tau \sigma$.  

        We will prove that
        $\lambda_\tau$ is one-to-one and onto, thus proving that $|A_n| =|B_n|$.  
        Since $S_n$ is the disjoint union of the sets $A_n$ and $B_n$, it will
        follow that exactly half of the permutations in $S_n$ are even and half
        are odd, so that $|A_n| = n!/2$.

        Indeed, let $\sigma, \rho$ be two arbitrary even permutation in $A_n$
        and suppose $\lambda_\tau(\sigma) = \lambda_\tau(\rho)$.  Then
        $\tau\sigma = \tau\rho$, so left multiplying both sides by 
        $\tau^{-1}=\tau$ we have $\sigma = \rho$. 
        This proves that $\lambda_\tau$ is one-to-one.

        Suppose $\mu$ is an arbitrary permutation in $B_n$.  We must show there
        is some permutation $\sigma \in A_n$ such that $\lambda_\tau(\sigma) = \mu$.
        Indeed, select $\sigma = \tau\mu$.  Then 
        $\lambda_\tau(\sigma) = \lambda_\tau(\tau\mu) =\tau\tau\mu = \mu$.  (The
        last equality holds since $\tau$ is a transposition, so 
        $\tau^2 = \mathrm{id}$; that is, $\tau = \tau^{-1}$.)

      \item Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be a function and define the relation $\sim$
        on the set $X$ as follows:
        \[
        m \sim n \quad \text{ if and only if } \quad f(m) = f(n)
        \]
        What kind of relation is $\sim$?  (Justify your answer by checking the properties.)

  Below I have drawn the subgroup lattice diagrams for the groups $\Z_2$, $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$,
  $\Z_7$, $\Z_{12}$, $\Z_{16}$, $\Z_{30}$, and $S_3$, but I've forgotten which diagram
  go with which group.  I was able to label the first diagram
  correctly.  If you think you can help me label the others, go for it. But
  don't guess!
