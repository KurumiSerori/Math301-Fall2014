<p><strong>Some remarks about office hours:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>The regularly scheduled office hours listed above are subject to change.
Changes will be announced during lecture.<br>
</li>
<li>Office hours are simply the hours during which I make a point of being
available in my office to answer questions.  However, students
are welcomed to stop by my office at anytime to check if I'm available.<br>
</li>
<li>It is helpful (but certainly not required) to send me an email in advance to let
me know when you plan to visit.</li>

<a name="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Math 166 or Math 166H<br>
</li>
<li>Math 317 or Math 407<br>
</li>
<li>Math 201 with a grade of C- or better<br>
The most important prerequisite for this class is Math 201.  If you did well in
Math 201, you can probably do well in this course.  Although you are not
expected to be skilled at constructing your own original proofs upon entering
this course, you should be familiar with some basic methods of proof, such as
induction.</li>
</ul><p>During the first few lectures, we will review some of the required background.
If this early material seems unfamiliar and difficult to you, this might
indicate that you will find the course very challenging.</p>

<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Basic theory of groups and other algebraic structures, with an emphasis on writing proofs.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Elementary theory of groups: subgroups, cyclic groups, permutation groups, cosets.<br>
</li>
<li>Brief introduction to lattices.<br>
</li>
<li>Isomorphisms, quotient groups, homomorphisms; group isomorphism theorems.<br>
</li>
<li>Group actions, Sylow theorems.<br>
</li>
<li>Introduction to rings. </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="learning-outcomes" class="anchor" href="#learning-outcomes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Outcomes</h2>

Develop skill in communicating mathematics. Develop competence in writing proofs. Construct proofs about the following mathematical structures and concepts: groups, lattices, homomorphisms, quotient groups, group actions, rings.

<h2>
<a name="homework" class="anchor" href="#homework"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Homework</h2>

<p><strong>Homework is worth 30%</strong> of the course grade and will be assigned roughly once
per week. Thus, students must solve many homework problems in order to do well
in the course.</p>

<p>Homework is announced in lecture approximately once per week, and is
usually due the week after it is announced (with exact due dates specified
in lecture).</p>

<p>I will do my best to keep <a href="homework">our homework page</a> updated with
a list of the problems that are due each week, but it is the students'
responsibility to show up for lecture to stay current with the course agenda.  </p>

<p>Although many homework problems will be assigned, only a limited number from
each assignment will be graded.  Therefore,
<a href="homework/solutions">solutions to many of the homework problems</a> will
be made available, with the expectation that students will read the correct
solutions, compare them with their own, and make whatever corrections are
necessary.  Students are not required to turn in corrected solutions, but
should collect them as they are useful when preparing for exams.</p>

<h2>
<a name="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h2>

<p><strong>Two Midterm Exams each worth 20%</strong> of the course grade will be given during the
  semester; the exact dates will be announced soon after the course begins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Midterm Dates: TBA</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>Final Exam is worth 30%</strong> of the course grade.
In accordance with university policy, the final exam must be taken by all
students at the scheduled time. <em>There are no make-up exams.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Final Exam Date: <strong>Monday, December 15, 9:45--11:45am</strong> in Carver 196</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="computing" class="anchor" href="#computing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computing</h2>

<p>No prior programming experience is required for this course, and the amount of
computing done in this class will be left up to the students.  I encourage, but
do not require, all students to use the computer to help develop intuition about
the algebraic structures that we will study, and I will provide some guidance in
this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Sage:</strong>
One of the best ways to develop a deeper understanding of many mathematical
subjects (abstract algebra in particular) is to use the computer to experiment
with and apply the theory.  For this purpose I recommend the open source math
software called <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>.  Sage essentially provides a
nice browser-based interface to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(mathematics_software)#Software_packages_contained_in_Sage">vast array</a> of well developed and powerful
open source mathematical software.</p>

<p>Getting started with Sage is extremely easy.  You don't even need to install any
software. By using Sage though a web browser you can and do all your computing,
and store all your sage worksheets, in the cloud.</p>

<p>It's also possible to download and install Sage on your own computer.  Sage is free
and open source, and it is typically not <em>too</em> hard to install. </p>

<p>If you've used Sage before and just need a quick refresher, you might
check out the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/quickstart.html">Sage Quick Start Guides</a>.  </p>

<p>If you are new to Sage, consider trying the following:</p>

<h2>
<a name="questions-and-online-discussions" class="anchor" href="#questions-and-online-discussions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions and Online Discussions</h2>

<p>You are welcome to ask lots of questions in this class (during lecture, in
office hours, via email, etc.).  You are especially encouraged to use a public 
forum to ask questions so that all students can benefit.
Please consider posting to the
<a href="https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/wiki">class wiki pages</a>
when you want to ask a question, or raise an issue, or start an online dialog
with the prof and/or your classmates. If you have any trouble editing
the class wiki pages, please <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com">notify the professor</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="disabilities-statement" class="anchor" href="#disabilities-statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disabilities Statement</h2>
<p>
If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures. The Disability Resources Office is located in the Student Services Building, Room 1076; phone number: 515-294-7220. The next step is to see me. I am happy to assist with accommodations, but I will not provide them retroactively (so file the appropriate requests and paperwork before the first exam!).
