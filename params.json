However, students\r\n  are welcomed to stop by my office at anytime to check if I'm available.  \r\n+ It is helpful (but certainly not required) to send me an email in advance to let\r\n  me know when you plan to visit.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou are now reading the main course webpage (which is simply a README.md\r\nfile in a GitHub repository called Math301-Fall2014).  If you don't know what\r\nthe stuff in parentheses means, don't worry. It will be explained at our first\r\nclass meeting. \r\n\r\nThe paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Section B of Math 301.\r\n\r\n*This page and the subdirectories of this repository (see links above) will\r\n be updated throughout the semester, and students are expected to visit this\r\n page routinely.* \r\n\r\nPlease bookmark this page or, better yet,\r\n<a href=\"mailto:?subject=MATH 301 webpage&amp;body=The Math 301 webpage is\r\n http://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014\">email the url of this\r\n page to yourself!</a>\r\n\r\nFor this class the ISU Blackboard system will be used only for recording test scores. \r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\r\n- [Overview](#overview)\r\n- [Textbook](#textbook)\r\n- [Homework](#homework)\r\n- [Exams](#exams)\r\n- [Computing](#computing)\r\n- [Questions and Online Discussions](#questions-and-online-discussions)\r\n- [Other references](#other-references)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n+ Math 166 or Math 166H  \r\n+ Math 317 or Math 407  \r\n+ Math 201 with a grade of C- or better  \r\nThe most important prerequisite for this class is Math 201.  If you did well in\r\nMath 201, you can probably do well in this course.  Although you are not\r\nexpected to be skilled at constructing your own original proofs upon entering\r\nthis course, you should be familiar with some basic methods of proof, such as\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few lectures, we will review some of the required background.\r\nIf this early material seems unfamiliar and difficult to you, this might\r\nindicate that you will find the course very challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\nBasic theory of groups and other algebraic structures, with an emphasis on writing proofs.  \r\n+ Elementary theory of groups: subgroups, cyclic groups, permutation groups, cosets.  \r\n+ Brief introduction to lattices.  \r\n+ Isomorphisms, quotient groups, homomorphisms; group isomorphism theorems.  \r\n+ Group actions, Sylow theorems.  \r\n+ Introduction to rings. \r\n\r\n\r\nTextbook\r\n--------\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://abstract.ups.edu/\"><IMG border=\"0\" src=\"misc/images/Judson.jpeg\" height=\"250\">  \r\n[Abstract Algebra: theory and applications](http://abstract.ups.edu/)\r\nby Tom Judson\r\n\r\nSee also the [other references](#other-references) below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHomework\r\n--------\r\n**Homework is worth 30%** of the course grade and will be assigned roughly once\r\nper week. Thus, students must solve many homework problems in order to do well\r\nin the course.\r\n\r\nHomework is announced in lecture approximately once per week, and is\r\nusually due the week after it is announced (with exact due dates specified\r\nin lecture).\r\n\r\nI will do my best to keep [our homework page](homework) updated with\r\na list of the problems that are due each week, but it is the students'\r\nresponsibility to show up for lecture to stay current with the course agenda.  \r\n\r\nAlthough many homework problems will be assigned, only a limited number from\r\neach assignment will be graded.  Therefore,\r\n[solutions to many of the homework problems](homework/solutions) will\r\nbe made available, with the expectation that students will read the correct\r\nsolutions, compare them with their own, and make whatever corrections are\r\nnecessary.  Students are not required to turn in corrected solutions, but\r\nshould collect them as they are useful when preparing for exams.\r\n\r\n\r\nExams\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Two Midterm Exams each worth 20%** of the course grade will be given during the\r\n  semester; the exact dates will be announced soon after the course begins.\r\n\r\n+ Midterm Dates: TBA\r\n\r\nThe **Final Exam is worth 30%** of the course grade.\r\nIn accordance with university policy, the final exam must be taken by all\r\nstudents at the scheduled time. *There are no make-up exams.*\r\n\r\n+ Final Exam Date: **Monday, December 15, 9:45--11:45am** in Carver 196\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComputing\r\n---------\r\n\r\nNo prior programming experience is required for this course, and the amount of\r\ncomputing done in this class will be left up to the students.  I encourage, but\r\ndo not require, all students to use the computer to help develop intuition about\r\nthe algebraic structures that we will study, and I will provide some guidance in\r\nthis regard.\r\n\r\n**Sage:**\r\nOne of the best ways to develop a deeper understanding of many mathematical\r\nsubjects (abstract algebra in particular) is to use the computer to experiment\r\nwith and apply the theory.  For this purpose I recommend the open source math\r\nsoftware called [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org).  Sage essentially provides a\r\nnice browser-based interface to a [vast array][] of well developed and powerful\r\nopen source mathematical software.\r\n\r\nGetting started with Sage is extremely easy.  You don't even need to install any\r\nsoftware. By using Sage though a web browser you can and do all your computing,\r\nand store all your sage worksheets, in the cloud.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to download and install Sage on your own computer.  Sage is free\r\nand open source, and it is typically not *too* hard to install. \r\n\r\nIf you've used Sage before and just need a quick refresher, you might\r\ncheck out the [Sage Quick Start Guides](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/quickstart.html).  \r\n\r\nIf you are new to Sage, consider trying the following:\r\n\r\n1. Go to http://www.sagemath.org/ and click [Try Sage Online](http://cloud.sagemath.com/).  \r\n2. [Getting started using Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/Logging-On.html) explains how to create an account.  \r\n3. Check out the [Sage Thematic Tutorials](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html)\r\n\r\nQuestions and Online Discussions\r\n--------------------------------\r\nYou are welcome to ask lots of questions in this class (during lecture, in\r\noffice hours, via email, etc.).  You are especially encouraged to use a public \r\nforum to ask questions so that all students can benefit.\r\nPlease consider posting to the\r\n[class wiki pages](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/wiki)\r\nwhen you want to ask a question, or raise an issue, or start an online dialog\r\nwith the prof and/or your classmates. If you have any trouble editing\r\nthe class wiki pages, please [notify the professor](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n\r\nOther References\r\n----------------\r\n[Our textbook](http://abstract.ups.edu/) should cover everything we need for\r\nthis course.  However, there are many other books that provide alternative\r\nexpositions of the same topics, and some are particularly good and might be\r\nworth a look.  Here are a few of your professor's favorites, along with some\r\ncomments about them:\r\n\r\n<!-- Herstein -->\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=229293.146&subid=0&type=4\"><IMG border=\"0\"  src=\"misc/images/Herstein.jpeg\" height=\"250\"></a>\r\n\r\n**Herstein**, *Topics in Algebra* -- covers roughly the same material as our\r\ntextbook, but at a slightly higher level of sophistication; used, for example,\r\nin an undergraduate honors abstract algebra course.\r\n\r\n<!-- Jacobson -->\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=229293.146&subid=0&type=4\"><IMG border=\"0\"  src=\"misc/images/Jacobson.jpeg\" height=\"250\"></a>\r\n\r\n**Jacobson**, *Basic Algebra I* -- covers roughly the same material as our textbook,\r\nbut at a higher level of sophistication; used, for example, as a textbook for\r\nadvanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.\r\n\r\n<!-- Rose -->\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=229293.146&subid=0&type=4\"><IMG border=\"0\"  src=\"misc/images/Rose.jpeg\" height=\"250\"></a>\r\n\r\n**Rose**, *A Course on Group Theory* -- We will spend a significant portion of our\r\ntime in this class studying *group theory*, and this book is an excellent\r\n(and inexpensive) introduction to the subject. Our textbook provides a\r\nsufficient treatment of group theory for our purposes, and Rose covers much more\r\nthan we will. However, you might find Rose's book useful if/when you are not\r\nsatisfied with our textbook's (or professor's) presentation of a particular topic. \r\n\r\n<!-- Dixon -->\r\n<a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xEro7OMQWE4&offerid=229293.146&subid=0&type=4\"><IMG border=\"0\"  src=\"misc/images/Dixon.jpeg\" height=\"250\"></a>\r\n\r\n**Dixon**, *Problems in Group Theory* -- our homework assignments should give you\r\nplenty of practice solving problems in group theory; if you want more, I highly\r\nrecommend the book by Dixon. \r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[vast array]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(mathematics_software)#Software_packages_contained_in_Sage\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
