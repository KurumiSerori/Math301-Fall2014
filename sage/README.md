Math 301, Fall 2014: Sage Information
-------------------------------------


## Sage Assignment 1

1. (1/4) Sign up for a Sage account at [sagemath.org](http://www.sagemath.org).  

2. (1/4) Create a new project named "Math 301" and then create a Sage Worksheet
  within that project.  Name your worksheet "Eratosthenes" or "Ackermann" or
  "DivisionAlgorithm" (depending on which problem you plan to solve in the next part).

3. (1/2) In the worksheet you created above, solve one of the three programming
  exercises described on page 35 of our textbook (the "Programming Exercises" at
  the end of Chapter 2).

To get credit for this assignment, when you have finished, you must either send
me your .sagews file by email, or invite me to be a collaborator on your Math 301
project. You must also email me a few sentences describing your experience and
your first impressions of Sage.

### Notes on Sage Assignment 1

The number in parentheses indicates the fraction of the percentage point that
each part is worth.

The following are some notes about each part of the assignment:

1. Go to [cloud.sagemath.org](http://cloud.sagemath.org/).

2. First create a new project by clicking the link that says "New
   Project."  Name the project "Math 301," then click the Math 301 link that
   appears.  Wait for your new project to load, then either click "New" or
   "Create or Import a File, Worksheet..." In the box where it says, "Name
   your file," enter the name "Eratosthenes" or "Ackermann" or
   "DivisionAlgorithm" (depending on which problem you plan to solve in the next
   part). Then, where it says "Select the type," choose "Sage Worksheet."

3. You are to solve one of the three problems described on
   [page 35 of our textbook](http://github.com/williamdemeo/Math301-Fall2014/homework/pdf/SageAssignment1.pdf).

There is plenty of online documentation for Sage. If you need help, please ask!
Also, you can find some nice examples of Sage programs that are specifically
related to our course at
